Force-locks the phone after timer expires

--if you're anything like me, you might enjoy falling asleep to the sound of some videos. The issue is that YouTube has ADs, premium costs money, and AutoPlay disabled seems to break every other week. So, as you fall asleep to the sound of whatever noise you're listening to, you wake up to a wasted battery. Well, no more.

It's a very, very simple app: launch it, enable permissions, select the app that you listen/watch videos on, set the timer, & launch the app. Once the timer expires, the phone locks down.

Nothing fancy or complex, but I couldn't find what I wanted anywhere else; most either seemed to have far more functions than I needed, or simply muted the video, so I made it myself.

Use it however you want.
